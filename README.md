# GhostWatch
Augmented Reality Android Application

This Android application is a AR game that aims to emulate the popular Pokemon GO app. Players will login to a server and search for ghosts on a map. Once a ghost is found, the AR camera activity starts and the player then battles the ghost.

The application implements technology such as the Google Maps API and the Wikitude Android SDK. 

The app currently consists of three main activities. 

A main activity for logging in to a server. (Authentication currently not implemented)

A map activity that shows player positions and randomly generates a "ghost" location.

A AR camera activity that loads a ghost into a camera scene.
